# Development Workflow

## Branching Strategy
- `main` → Production-ready code
- `dev` → Active development
- `feature-branch` → New features

## Contributing
1. **Create a branch**  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```
2. **Commit changes**  
   ```bash
   git commit -m "[Feature] Added new functionality"
   ```
3. **Push and create a PR**  
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-name
   ```
